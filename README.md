# ue5-fruitstration-gameoff-2023

Fruitstration is a unique fruit-slicing game that combines the fun of Fruit Ninja with the hardness and frustration of Dark Souls :)

The game uses a procedural system that lets players cut the fruits in any shape. The main goal is to cut single pieces of fruit that match the weight asked in the order. The player can achieve this by checking the weight on the scale, cutting, rechecking the weight, cutting again until you have it correct before the time runs out.

Currently, the game contains 10 levels/challenges.  Good luck!

Game created for the Game Off 2023. The chosen theme was SCALE!
